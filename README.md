## Description
We have here a webpage published on Heroku to use express.js to have a functional note taker for the busy professional. The information is stored and can be retrieved back even after leaving the site.

We used express.js and the various methods we can call upon to make the functions work.

This project was particularly difficult due to the naming convention confusing me during the composition of the code. After some trial and error with a different project, I was able to find a solution. In the future, I would like to be able to implement categories for the notes so they can be minimized in the side bar, edit the notes that are already saved, and have a feedback page for future development.
